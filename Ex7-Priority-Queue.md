# Ex2B Priority Queue
## DATE: 5/03/2025
## AIM:
To formulate the C code to display the elements of the priority queue after insertion and deletion operation.

## Algorithm
1.	Start
2.	Define a function printArray() that takes an array and its size as parameters.
3.	Loop through the array from index 0 to size-1.
4.	Print each element of the array during the loop.
5.	After printing all elements, print a newline for formatting.
6.	End   

## Program:
```
/*
Program to o display the elements of the priority queue after insertion and deletion operation
Developed by: DINESHKARTHIK N
RegisterNumber: 212223220021
*/

/*#include <stdio.h>
int size = 0;
*/
void printArray(int array[], int size) {
  int i;
  for(i=0;i<size;i++)
   printf("%d ",array[i]);
}

```

## Output:
![1748750359336](image/Ex7-Priority-Queue/1748750359336.png)

## Result:
Thus, the C program to display the elements of the priority queue after insertion and deletion operation is implemented successfully
